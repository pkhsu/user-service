# Current Work Context

## Current Focus
- Solidify the connection between the `user-service` backend and the `user-admin` frontend.
- Ensure the system is fully functional and ready for further development.
- Prepare for adding more robust features like authentication and testing.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented `UserController` to expose RESTful endpoints.
- Created a `user-admin` frontend using Streamlit.
- Containerized both backend and frontend services using Docker.
- Fixed a critical MongoDB authentication issue.
- Successfully tested the end-to-end functionality of creating and retrieving users.

## Next Steps
1. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `user-service`.
2. Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
3. Implement a more robust error handling mechanism.
4. Begin work on user authentication and authorization.

## Open Issues
- User password encryption strategy.
- API authentication/authorization mechanism.
- Lack of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Decisions
- Using MongoDB as the primary database.
- Adopted a three-layer architecture for the backend.
- RESTful API style for the backend.
- Using Streamlit for a simple administrative frontend.
