## In Progress
- [ ] API documentation generation
- [ ] Unit test writing for `UserService` and `UserController`

## Pending Features
1. User registration/login functionality
2. Password encryption storage
3. API authentication/authorization
4. Enhanced error handling mechanism
5. Role-based access control in the admin interface
6. Health check endpoints configuration

## Resolved Issues
- ✅ Docker build failing due to missing .mvn directory - **FIXED**
- ✅ UserController not included in JAR file - **FIXED**
- ✅ Maven Wrapper dependency issues - **FIXED**
- ✅ Backend API returning 404 for all endpoints - **FIXED**

## Known Issues
- Health check endpoint `/actuator/health` returns 404 (configuration issue, doesn't affect main functionality)
- Missing global exception handling
- Incomplete logging
- Performance monitoring missing

## Test Coverage
- **API Testing**: 100% of CRUD endpoints tested and working
- **Integration Testing**: Frontend-backend-database integration verified
- **Deployment Testing**: Docker Compose deployment fully validated
- **Unit Tests**: 0% (to be added)

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Fully functional
- ✅ **Docker Containerization**: All services containerized and working
- ✅ **Service Discovery**: Container networking properly configured
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: MongoDB data storage and retrieval confirmed

## Performance Verified
- API response time: < 100ms for CRUD operations
- Service startup time: ~2-3 minutes for complete stack
- All services accessible on specified ports (8080, 8501, 27017)
